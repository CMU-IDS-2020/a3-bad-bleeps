## Project Goals

TODO: **A clear description of the goals of your project.** Describe the question that you are enabling a user to answer. The question should be compelling and the solution should be focused on helping users achieve their goals.Â 

The goal of this project was to help users visualize what factors affected crime and arrest rates in Chicago.

## Design

TODO: **A rationale for your design decisions.** How did you choose your particular visual encodings and interaction techniques? What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices?

## Development

TODO: **An overview of your development process.** Describe how the work was split among the team members. Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? What aspects took the most time?

Workwas split by topic; one team member focused more on visualizations for crime types, and another focuesd more on visualizations for crimes by district. This project built off of one that was done for HW2, so we already explored the data and new what variables we wanted to let users explore more. The most time-consuming part of the development was trying tp make visualizations that matched what we imagined in our heads.
